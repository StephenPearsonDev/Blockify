# Blockify

**Blockify** is a Java-based puzzle game inspired by the classic game of Tetris. This project is very much a work in progress (WIP), and while it is currently in a playable state, there is a lot of refactoring and feature enhancements needed. This is an old project that I am updating, and it serves as a learning tool for improving game development techniques in Java.
